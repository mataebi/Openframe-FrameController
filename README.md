# Openframe Frame Controller

This is a fork and updated version of the [original Openframe Frame Conroller project](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe). This README file explains how to install and configure the Openframe frame controller.

## Overview

The Openframe frame controller is the software that runs on the frame itself (i.e. the RPi), acting as a process manager for starting, stopping, and transitioning between artworks. It communicates with an [Openframe API Server](https://github.com/mataebi/Openframe-APIServer) server via a REST API, and connects to a [global event system](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe-PubSubServer) allowing for realtime updates. The idea is to work towards a system which supports the basic goals of Openframe, guided by a handful of [pilot use cases](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe-APIServer/wiki/Pilot-Use-Cases).

The block diagram below represents the proposed architecture for the Openframe platform as of today

## Install Node and NPM
The Openframe frame controller is based on nodejs and npm so these packages have to be installed first. There are two ways to do this which are explained below.

### NVM based Installation
In order to be able to run the frame controller software without root privileges but still be able to easily install node modules the software needs to run based on the node virtual machine (nmv). This also makes it possible to test the software with different vesions of the underlying node environment. In order to install nvm use the following commands:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
After installing nvm the system is now ready to install any version of node and npm needed. You may just use the major version number for installation and nvm will automatically figure out the latetst minor and patch version. nodejs 14 has proven to run well with the Openframe frame controller. So use the following commands to install it:
```
nvm install 14
```
To list the versions available under nvm use the following command:
```
nvm ls
        v7.10.1
        v8.17.0
        v9.11.2
       v12.22.6
->     v14.18.0
```
To activate one of the available version use the following command
```
nvm use 14
Now using node v14.18.0 (npm v6.14.15)
```

## Install the Openframe frame controller
Change to the current users home directory and clone the Openframe-FrameController repository from https://github.com/mataebi/Openframe-FrameController.git
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/mataebi/Openframe-FrameController.git
cd Openframe-FrameController
```

Do **not** run the install.sh script in the repository as it would try to install the frame controller software from npm.

Now setup the settings directory manually and copy the main configuration file (.ofrc) and the autostart script into it
```
mkdir -p ~/.openframe
cp -p .ofrc ~/.openframe/
env | grep NVM_ > ~/.openframe/.env
cp ./scripts/autoboot.sh ~/.openframe/autoboot.sh
```

If you plan to setup and use your own Openframe server instead of the public system available at www.openframe.io you need to edit the frame controller configuration file (.ofrc) and adjust the URLs of the API and the web app server to match your services.
```
vi ~/.openframe/.ofrc
...
    "api_base": "https://oframe-api.example.com",
    "app_base": "https://oframe.example.com"
...
```

Now run `npm install` and `npm audit fix` to download and install all dependencies for the frame controller package and make sure at least part of the potential security risks in depnendencies are properly taken care of. This installation will also include the installtion of the four default extensions that will be downloaded and installed from npmjs.com.

Each of these extensions needs certain tools, libraries and executables that will also be installed during code initialization. So at each question asking `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]` just answer with `y`.
```
npm install
npm audit fix
```

To start, stop and monitor the frame controller software we use a system service in the background. So you need to install and activate the system service definition (of-framectrl.service) delivered as part of this repository executing the following commands:
```
sudo cp -p ~/Openframe-FrameController/scripts/of-framectrl.service /lib/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable of-framectrl.service
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

Activate the `openframe` command by creating a link, then start the `openframe` software.
```
sudo ln -s ~/Openframe-FrameController/bin/cli.js /usr/local/bin/openframe
openframe
```
Once started, the first time or when using the `-r` or '--reset' option to reconfigure the frane, the Openframe frame controller software will ask you the following questions to connect the frame o the Openframe services:
```
...
? Enter your Openframe username: ppan
? Enter your Openframe password: ******
? Enter a name for this Frame: my-frame
? Do you want to boot openframe on startup?: (Y/n) y
```
After a shor while you should see the following messages indicating that the software has been started properly:
```
[o]   Connected! You can now push artwork to this frame.
This frame should now appear as my-frame when you log into Openframe at https://oframe.example.com.
```
If something goes wrong and you need logging information to figure out what the problem might be, use the following command. Usng the `-f`opion will show the latest log information in an ongoing way. Leaving this flag away will instead show all log information collected so far:
```
journalctl -f -u of-framectrl
```
To stop the openframe controller software use the following command:
```
openframe -s
```
If you wan to reset the frame to rename it, connec i to a different server or change the credentias used to login to the openframe server use the command below. This will reset all configuration data and announce the frame as a new device to the servers `specified in ~/.openframe/.ofrc`:
```
openframe -r
? Enter your Openframe username: ppan
...
```
To install or remove a openframe viewer extension use the following commands:
```
# Install openframe extension
openframe -i <extension-name> #

# Uninstall openframe extension
openframe -u <extension-name> #
```
`<extension-name>` must be specified as one of the following
```
# Gihtub repository, master branch
gihub:mataebi/Openframe-ImageViewer

# Gihtub repository, specific branch, e.g. mybranch
gihub:mataebi/Openframe-ImageViewer#mybranch

# Local directory containing the files of an extension
file:~/my-local-ext/

# NPM package name (latest version)
openframe-image

# NPM package name, specific version
openframe-image@^0.1.0
```
After (un)installing an extension, you have to stop and start the openframe controller in order to activate the change
```
openframe -s; openframe
```

#### Modules

* `controller.js` - manages the actions around controlling the frame (changing artwork, updating settings, etc.)
* `process-manager.js` - manages starting and stopping processes for displaying artworks
* `extensions-manager.js` - manages installing and initializing extensions (aka plugins)
* `frame.js` - a wrapper for the Frame model, which gets persisted to
* `user.js` - a wrapper for the User model
* `pubsub.js` - creates and manages connection to global event system
* `rest.js` - creates and manages connection to REST API via Swagger.js
* `downloader.js` - utility for downloading files
* `config.js` - configuration options

Upon startup, the application will prompt you for your Openframe username and password, and a name for this frame. You can run this on a mac or linux machine (windows untested), though various artwork format extensions are likely to be developed with a specific target platform in mind.

For DEBUG output, set the DEBUG env var:

```bash
$ DEBUG=* openframe
```

### Configuration files

When you run `npm install`, the `install.sh` script will be executed. This script creates a hidden directory, `.openframe`, in your user home folder (/home/{username}/.openframe), and copies the default `.ofrc`configuration file there. The `.ofrc` file contains the server settings â€” by default this will point to the hosted API server at openframe.io, but if you're running a local server for development or are hosting your own API server you can update the settings in `.ofrc` accordingly.

After starting the application and answering the prompts, two additional files are created in the `.openframe` dir, `frame.json` which stores the frame state, and `user.json` which stores user data.

### Extensions

Extensions are npm packages which add functionality to the frame, either by adding support for a new artwork format (i.e. media type) or by adding other functionality.

For more info on extensions, see the [Openframe-Extension](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe-Extension) repo.
